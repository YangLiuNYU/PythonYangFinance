## Motivation
I begin to learn stock investment.
Nevertheless being an absolute beginer on stock trading, I know that a good/decent investment should based on some criteria.
One dumb strategy I am using regularlly is to choose company whose PE ratio is low and return on asset ratio is high.
However, I really don't want to search these stock one by one on no matter Yahoo finance or TD ameritrade.

So, why not write some tool to help me choose stock by pulling all the data from these financial data API ?
